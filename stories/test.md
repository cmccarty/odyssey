Once the shirt is made, it is often sent to cities like New York, where it is screen printed with designs, or sold as-is. Round trip, that's over 20,000 miles for one shirt!

Used shirts often end up in charity bins. These charities often ship their used clothes collections off to cities like Kampala, Uganda, where they end up in crowded second-hand markets.
